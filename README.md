\# 🧱 ASCII-Forge



\*\*ASCII-Forge\*\* is a Python-based AI project that transforms text prompts into structured ASCII art.  

It focuses on generating visual compositions entirely from characters, treating ASCII as a visual language rather than a simple text format.



The goal of the project is to develop a model capable of interpreting natural-language descriptions and rendering them as fixed-grid ASCII images.  

Future extensions may include image-to-ASCII conversion and advanced character-based diffusion models.
